HEY YOU MAN - THESE SKRIPTS REQUIRE OP ON BASE (customize how u like) DONT SAY THEY DONT WORK




⚠️ Disclaimer
All Skripts included in this repository are community-made, unofficial, and NOT guaranteed to work perfectly.
They may be bugged, broken, outdated, or require manual tweaks depending on your server version or setup.

💻 Requirements

Minecraft Paper / Spigot / Purpur server (1.19 → 1.21+ recommended)

Skript plugin installed (latest stable version)

Basic knowledge of Skript syntax (you should know how to edit variables, options, and fix minor errors)

Optional but recommended:

SkBee

skript-yaml

SkQuery

⚙️ Installation

Stop your server (optional but safest).

Drop the .sk files into:

/plugins/Skript/scripts/


Start your server or reload Skript using:

/sk reload all


If a file errors, read the console — fix missing addons or syntax for your Skript version.

🧩 Permissions
Default permissions may include:

sk.player — normal players

sk.mod — moderators / staff

sk.admin — admin or owner

Adjust or rename them for your own permission plugin (LuckPerms, PermissionsEx, etc).
